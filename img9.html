    <p>Raanjhan is a soulful romantic track that beautifully captures the intensity of love wrapped in longing, desire, and emotional depth. Sung with heartfelt emotion, the song expresses the feeling of finding someone who touches your soul, yet brings with them a whirlwind of passion and pain. The melody is smooth, intimate, and filled with a kind of romance that feels almost cinematic — where every glance, touch, and silence speaks louder than words. With poetic lyrics, the song portrays a love that is irresistible, magnetic, and deeply consuming, the kind that changes everything forever. It reflects the beauty of surrendering to love, even when the heart fears the consequences. Raanjhan resonates with anyone who has ever fallen for someone so intensely that their presence becomes both comfort and chaos — a love that becomes a heartbeat, a memory, and a destiny.</p>
