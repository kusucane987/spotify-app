    <p>The Sanam Teri Kasam title track is an emotionally charged and heart-rending song that portrays the agony of unspoken love and the pain of losing someone who meant everything. With soulful vocals and deeply poetic lyrics, the song reflects the silent suffering, longing, and sacrifices made in the name of true love. It beautifully captures the feeling of loving someone beyond limits, yet being unable to hold onto them. The melody carries a haunting intensity that lingers long after the song ends, touching the heart with its raw emotions. Every verse reveals the helplessness, broken trust, and shattered dreams that come with a love story that wasn’t meant to be. It is a song for those who have loved deeply, silently, and forever — even when destiny had other plans.</p>
